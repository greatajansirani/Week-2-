# Week-1-
  AI-Driven Dynamic EV Charging Price Optimization and Smart Grid Load Balancing System with Intelligent Chatbot Assistant
  
 Project Overview
  
This project aims to develop an AI-based system that dynamically optimizes electric vehicle (EV) charging prices to balance power loads across residential and commercial networks in a smart grid environment.
It also integrates a Generative AI chatbot assistant to provide real-time recommendations, explain system performance, and generate automated reports.

Objectives

Apply machine learning and optimization to regulate EV charging demand.
Implement dynamic pricing to minimize peak loads.
Visualize real-time metrics using a Streamlit dashboard.
Integrate an AI chatbot to assist users and provide data insights.
